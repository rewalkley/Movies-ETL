# Movies-ETL

The purpose of this challenge was to create cleaned databases from large raw datasets. 

We cleaned by removing duplicate entries, adjusted the column headers to be more readable, and adjusted formatting.

Also, we added the tables to our pgAdmin database for review.


NOTE: the datasets for Movies and ratings were too large to upload to github, so they are left out of the Resource folder.
